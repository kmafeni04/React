          </li>
          <li>
            <ol type="a" className="A">
              <li>
                In order to register an Account, you represent, warrant and
                agree that you are: (i) 18 years old; (ii) you will provide
                accurate registration information when registering the Account,
                including, without limitation, full name, the correct date of
                birth, country of residency, email address and telephone number
                and notify us of any changes of such details; (iii) you are
                opening the Account for your personal use and are acting as the
                principal and not on behalf of third party; (iv) you are legally
                capable of entering into binding contracts, including these
                Terms of Use and each subsequent bet or game play.

              <li>
                AfriPrize reserves the right to verify the User’s age at any
                time. In the event that you are found to have breached the
                clause 2 (a) or any of the representations and warranties

                placed; (ii) not pay any winnings that may otherwise be payable
                in respect of such bet; (iii) terminate the Account and (iv)
                refer the matter to the police, notify the family and/or

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            By registering an Account and/or using any Services or the Website,
            you hereby agree that we shall be entitled to conduct any and all
            such identification, credit and other verification checks from time
            to time that we may require or deem necessary and/or are required by
            applicable laws and regulations, and/or by the relevant regulatory
            authority. You agree to provide all such information as we require
            in connection with such verification checks. AfriPrize shall be
            entitled to suspend or restrict your Account and/or any of the
            Services or part thereof in any manner that we may deem to be
            appropriate, until such time as the relevant checks are completed to
            our satisfaction. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event we
            cannot successfully verify any of the elements of the Account
            registered details or if any information provided is deemed to be
            false or inaccurate, AfriPrize reserves the right to void any of the
            bets, suspend or terminate your Account and forfeit the balance of
            your Account. AfriPrize reserves the right to engage a third party
            to perform verification checks. Any information you provide to
            AfriPrize for Account registration or send to AfriPrize as part of
            the Account management or verification procedures shall be used in
            accordance with the Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to
            ensure that all details you provide us in satisfaction of our
            verification checks are kept up to date.
          </li>
          <li>
            You cannot buy, sell or transfer the Account to other User(s). You
            shall not transfer or sell your Account and/or acquire or accept a
            transfer of another registered Account with AfriPrize from another
            person.
          </li>
          <li>
            AfriPrize does not allow any of its employees, anyone else in any
            way connected to such employee or anyone otherwise connected to a
            third party service provider or an agent (to be determined at
            AfriPrize’s absolute discretion) to bet on any market or event. All
            such bets shall be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every User may open only one Account. If we have reasonable grounds
            to believe that you have more than one Account (including any
            Accounts you opened with misspellings or different variations of
            your name or email) and we reasonably believe that multiple Accounts
            have been opened or used in breach of the Terms of Use, we may close
            your Accounts, or allow you to retain only the first Account you
            opened with us. We will be entitled to declare all bets placed under
            any duplicate Account(s) as void and withhold any winning payments.
          </li>
          <li>
            When opening an Account, you may be allocated or may be requested to
            choose the username and will need to create a password. You must
            keep all Account information secure at all times, including the
            Account username and password. You are responsible for the security
            of your Account and all transactions performed under your Account.
            If you lose or forget your username and/or password, you should
            change your password without delay via your Account, the Website or
            by contacting us. If you believe or have reasons to suspect that a
            third party is aware of or may have access to any Account
            information, including your email or mobile number, contact us
            immediately.  AfriPrize has no reason to believe that at the time of
            acceptance of the bet, the bet was not placed by you. All the bets
            will stand if the correct username and password are entered to
            access the Account. AfriPrize shall not be liable for any loss that
            you may incur as a result of misuse of username(s) and/or
            passwords(s) or from any unauthorised use of your Account, whether
            fraudulent or otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            The User can request termination of their Account whenever they wish
            by sending a request to the Customer Service in writing, via email
            to …………………….. (email address) or visiting their Account. Any
            negative balance on the Account will be immediately due and payable
            to AfriPrize and the Account cannot be terminated until such amount
            is paid in full. An Account terminated by you may be reopened
            depending on the circumstances and the reasons for Account
            termination, on your request and at AfriPrize’s discretion, subject
            to successful identity verification checks. In such event, the use
            of the Website and/or the Services shall be subject to the Terms of
            Use that are in force at the date of Account reactivation. You will
            not be able to register a new account with AfriPrize once your
            Account has been closed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Without limiting any rights of AfriPrize hereunder or in law, if
            AfriPrize reasonably believes, at its sole discretion, that you have
            breached these Terms of Use, including any of sports or game rules
            and terms and conditions applicable to any specific functionality,
            bonus or promotion, or actual or suspected prohibited behaviour
            leading to collusion or fraud or activity aimed at defrauding
            AfriPrize, or there has been unusual activity on the Account, or for
            any legal reasons, AfriPrize may:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>suspend your Account for up to 90 days; and/or</li>
              <li>
                restrict you from withdrawing funds from your Account and/or
                making deposits and/or placing the bets; and/or
              </li>
              <li>prevent you from accessing your Account; and/or</li>
              <li>terminate your Account.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              AfriPrize may require you to provide any additional information
              that is necessary to conduct an investigation and/or verify your
              compliance with these Terms of Use (including an identification
              documentation and/or documentation from your payment provider).
            </p>
            <p>
              AfriPrize may notify you of the Account suspension using the email
              address registered under the Account or via online pop-up notice
              when logging into your Account, provided such notification will at
              no time be a pre-condition for any suspension or termination of
              the Account, as the case may be. AfriPrize will address the issue
              that has given rise to the Account suspension as soon as may be
              reasonably practicable, including requesting verification
              information from you. As a result of the review or investigation,
              the Account and/or any specific suspended functionality will be
              either re-activated or terminated. If any potentially suspicious
              activity is performed under your Account, you may be requested to
              provide us with additional documentation confirming your identity
              or source of funds or address. Such evidence may be requested due
              to, but not limited to the same, the size, volume or pattern of
              bets placed under the Account. AfriPrize may suspend or close your
              Account immediately as a result of the activity that cannot be
              verified by supporting evidence. If AfriPrize terminates the
              Account pursuant to the foregoing or due to your breach of any of
              the Terms of Use, and you have placed any bets on the events that
              have not yet taken place as of the time of the termination of the
              Account, AfriPrize reserves the right to void such bets and return
              the original stakes to your Account balance; this includes the
              multiple bets which will be recalculated and settled accordingly.
              In the event of termination of the Account for the reasons of
              fraud or associated fraudulent type of behaviour, any residual
              credit balance, including the winnings may be forfeited and the
              open bets void. On termination of the Account, your rights to use
              the Services shall immediately terminate. It is your sole
              responsibility to uninstall or remove any software used in
              relation to the use of the Website and/or the Services, as you may
              deem appropriate.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Account Suspension and Termination.
            <p>
              Without limiting or restricting AfriPrize’s rights and/or remedies
              available to it hereunder or in law, we may exclude the User from
              the Services, suspend and/or terminate the Account and/or cancel
              any bets placed under the Account, including the winning bets, at
              our absolute discretion and without having to disclose the reason.
              If you have any query regarding your Account, it is your sole
              responsibility to notify AfriPrize as soon as possible and provide
              all relevant information you know or have in relation to the query
              or as we may require.
            </p>

              funds which will be forfeited) into your Account, unless such
              funds are not due to you as per these Terms or Use or otherwise.
              We reserve the right to  withhold the funds in the Account from
              you pending determination of any investigation where we suspect

              withhold the funds by law or to comply with any request or
              instruction form any governmental or regulatory authority.
              AfriPrize shall not be liable to you for any termination of the

            involved in fraud, dishonest or criminal acts, we reserve the right

            where we may void a bet as detailed under the specific sport/event
            rules, or as otherwise instructed by an appropriate regulator or
            authority).  You shall indemnify and shall be liable to pay us, on

        <h3>V. DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You can deposit the funds into your Account with one of the payment
            methods made available by AfriPrize. AfriPrize reserves the right to
            verify the ownership of the payment method(s) utilised to credit
            your Account and/or ownership or origin of the funds by requesting
            supporting evidence from you. If you deposit funds using a payment
            method (bank account, credit or debit card) that is not registered
            or issued in your name, and without limiting our rights, we may (i)
            suspend your Account and/or (ii) request from you additional
            information and documentation we may deem necessary to demonstrate
            that you are authorised to use the respective payment method. Your
            Account may remain suspended until you provide and we verify the
            information and/or documentation requested. Any bank account you
            register under the Account, at Account registration or otherwise,
            must be operated by a Nigerian licensed bank and be registered in
            your name only. In no way does this limit the other remedies that
            may be available to us in the event that you did not have permission
            and authorisation to use another person’s payment method or if any
            of the Services require the deposit(s) to be made from the payment
            method that is issued or registered in your name. If we determine
            that a deposit into your Account is made from a payment method held
            or issued in third party’s name, or from the monies provided to you
            by a third party to be used for wagering, then we may elect to
            refund the deposit directly back to its source. If this
            determination occurs after bets have been placed, your bets will be
            voided and we will not be obliged to pay any winnings which might
            otherwise have been payable to you or reimburse you for any loss
            incurred. AfriPrize does not charge the fees for deposits made by
            bank transfers, credit or debit cards however, your payment
            provider’s charges may apply. The minimum and maximum deposit amount
            may apply depending on the type of the payment method you choose and
            you can only bet up to the amount available on your Account and
            subject to the minimum and maximum limits then applicable to the
            bets. Please refer to our FAQs and help pages. Any deposits that are
            subject to the bonus promotion offer will be regulated by the bonus
            promotion rules and may not be available for withdrawal.

            type of payment method presented to us irrespective of whether we
            have previously accepted such payment method type from you or would
            usually accept that payment type from any User.

            method to another, including, without limitation un-played deposits
            withdrawals and in the event the User cannot provide satisfactory
            evidence of the payment method ownership.

            available under the Account until the completion of the verification
            checks and/or suspend the Account and/or any of the Services
            availability. Without limiting the provisions of Clause III (3),
            upon withdrawal request initiated by you, you may be  requested to
            send us a copy of your ID (front/rear)  and any or all of the
            following documents : – In case of credit card transactions, a copy

            The User shall not attempt any charge-backs, reversals or otherwise

            matter seriously. Gambling should be an exciting pastime, and we
            urge our Users to have fun, but not bet beyond their means.
            AfriPrize is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its
            Users as well as promoting the awareness of problem gambling and
            improving prevention, intervention and treatment.

          <li>
            We undertake any effort in order to ensure your pleasant online

            associated with problem gambling. With regard to the purposes
            pointed out herewith, we do strongly suggest our Users to try
            keeping clearly separate gambling from his/her daily activities;
            considering the lasting time of each gambling session before its
            commencing; not to treat gambling as an alternative source of income
            or a way to recoup debit.

            AfriPrize makes an effort to ensure there are no errors made in its
            systems utilised to make the Website and/or the Services available
            for use. However, human and/or system’s error may occasionally
            result in errors. AfriPrize reserves the right to correct any error,
            whenever identified, and to void any bets placed where such error
            occurred.
          </li>
          <li>
            A number of circumstances may arise where a bet is accepted, or a
            payment is made by us in error. A non-exhaustive list of such
            circumstances is as follows:
            <ol type="a" className="A">
              <li>
                where we misstate any odds or terms of a bet as a result of
                obvious error or omission in inputting the information or
                setting up a market, or as a result of a computer malfunction;
              </li>
              <li>
                where we have made a ‘palpable error’. A palpable error occurs
                where:
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>
                    in relation to bets placed prior to an event taking place,
                    the prices/terms offered are materially different from those
                    available in the general market; or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    in relation to any event, the price/terms offered at the
                    time the bet is placed are clearly incorrect given the
                    probability of the event occurring;
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                where we have continued to accept bets on a market which should
                have been suspended or had already finished (referred to as
                ‘late bets’);
              </li>
              <li>
                where an error has been made as a result of your fraudulent or
                prohibited activity or activity under your Account in breach of
                the Terms of Use;
              </li>
              <li>
